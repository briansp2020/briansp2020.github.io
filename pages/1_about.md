## About me

I am a software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I received an MS in Computer Science from UCLA and have been working on embedded systems for most of my career but recently fell in love with Big Data, Machine Learning and GPGPU. I am also a MOOC enthusiast and like to decorate my LinkedIn profile with MOOC certificates.
